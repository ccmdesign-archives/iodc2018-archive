    <p>The global open data community is invited to submit proposals for sessions to be included in the agenda for the 2018 International Open Data Conference to be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina on September 20-21, 2018.</p>
    <p>This year marks 10 years since the idea of open data first started to gain global traction, but today, a decade later, openness has never been more important, nor it has been more under threat.</p>
    <p>From social media to artificial intelligence and a range of privacy issues, we live in a world where data increasingly both drives the economy, and simultaneously, creates disruption across every sector of society.</p> 
    <p>This year’s conference will strive to address the key issues, challenges, and problems facing the open data community by seeking to identify innovative solutions, partnership opportunities, and collaborative ventures that can translate to real progress moving forward.</p>
    <p>Under the Theme <strong class="long-text__highlight">“The Future is Open”</strong>, IODC 2018 will build on the incredibly success of past conferences to develop a more innovative conference experience. The organizers of IODC 2018 are seeking the help and support of the global open data community through this call for proposals to co-create a forward-focused programme of interactive sessions, workshops, guided discussions, and events.</p>
    <p>We are inviting proposals between now and March 1, 2018 that seek to help shape the future of open data.</p> 
    <p class="long-text__highlight">A strong preference will be given to proposals that identify a problem then seek to solve it through highly interactive sessions that provide an opportunity for presenters and participants to work together to develop innovative solutions, new partnerships, or other follow-up actions to IODC 2018.</p>
    <p>You may submit more than one proposal, but each submission must be made separately. Submissions must be received no later than <strong>April 1st, 2018</strong>.</p>
    <p>The working languages of IODC 2018 will be both <strong>English and Spanish</strong>; thus, proposals and presentations will be accepted in both languages. Should your proposal be accepted, please note that sessions must be delivered in person.</p>
    <p>All submissions received during the Call for Proposals will be reviewed by the <a href="{{ '/iodc-programme-committee.html' | relative_url }}"><strong>IODC Programme Committee</strong></a>. The Programme Committee is comprised of a wide range of open data subject matter experts representing open data organizations, academic institutions, governments, and the private sector. They have generously contributed their time to ensure the best possible programme for IODC 2018.</p>
    <p>Please note that everyone (attendees and session participants) in IODC 2018 must adhere to the terms and conditions of the <a href="{{ '/code-of-conduct.html' | relative_url }}"><strong>IODC Code of Conduct</strong></a>.</p>
